### Appointment System for medical stations
The project consists of a simple appointment system, with two user types: patients and doctors. 
Patients can make appointments to different doctors on different dates. Th
A doctor can have a maximum of 8 appointments a day. Doctors can add a diagnosis, and treatment details to each appointment. The diagnosis and treatment details can later be viewed by the pacients.


### Installation 
There are two folders "client" and "server". In each folder the command:
```
npm install
```
needs to be run.

After that the client will be run with the command:
```
npm run serve
``` 
and for the server 
```
node run.js
```
